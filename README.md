WorkOS Quick Access (QuAc) Docs Demo

# About

This is a demo for a quick access documentation feature for WorkOS' dashboard. 
Instead of having to open up another window to browse the docs - you can view them from your dashboard.

# Issues

- Navigating between different sections of the docs from the search bar causes the docs popup to stall - on the hosted demo. Clone the repository and run it on your local machine and you won't encounter this problem. 
- Left side bar glitches slightly when scrolling docs
